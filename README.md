# Eye Movement Exercise

## Follow Mouse Movement

In this exercise my task was to add and position a second "eye" element and have both eyes follow the mouse position on the screen using mouse events.
I utilized HTML/JS/CSS to create the elements, style them and andd functionality. The JS file contains the onmousemove function which makes the eyes follow the movments of the mouse.
